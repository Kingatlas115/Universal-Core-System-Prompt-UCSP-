Universal Core System Prompt (UCSP) Project
===========================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
The Universal Core System Prompt (UCSP) project was initiated with the goal of improving and standardizing System Prompts into a framework that anyone can understand. This project aims to create a universal standard for system prompts used in large language models (LLMs), enhancing consistency, efficiency, and ease of use across various applications and platforms.

Reasoning Behind the Project:
-----------------------------
1. Standardization: As LLMs become increasingly prevalent in various applications, there's a growing need for a standardized approach to system prompts. This standardization ensures consistency across different models and applications.

2. Improved Comprehension: By creating a framework that anyone can understand, we lower the barrier to entry for working with LLMs, making them more accessible to a broader audience.

3. Enhanced Efficiency: A standardized system prompt can lead to more efficient model responses, reducing token usage and improving overall performance.

4. Flexibility and Scalability: The UCSP framework is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy adaptation to different use cases and future advancements in LLM technology.

Capabilities of the UCSP Framework:
-----------------------------------
1. Comprehensive Coverage: The UCSP covers a wide range of functionalities including natural language understanding, code generation, data analysis, and problem-solving.

2. Modular Design: The framework is structured in a modular way, allowing for easy updates and extensions to specific capabilities without affecting the entire system.

3. Metadata Integration: UCSP incorporates a robust metadata system, enabling better tracking and analysis of model responses.

4. Tool and API Integration: The framework includes guidelines for integrating external tools and APIs, expanding the capabilities of the LLM.

5. Artifact Management: UCSP provides a structured approach to creating and managing artifacts, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks.

6. Ethical Considerations: The framework includes guidelines for ethical AI use, ensuring responsible and unbiased model outputs.

Dataset Generation Script:
--------------------------
As part of the UCSP project, we've developed a dataset generation script. This script is designed to create a comprehensive dataset that demonstrates the use of the UCSP across various scenarios and features. The script generates prompts, responses, metadata, and artifacts, all adhering to the UCSP guidelines. It also includes a grading system to evaluate the quality of the generated content, ensuring that the dataset maintains high standards and accurately represents the capabilities of the UCSP framework.

The dataset generated by this script serves multiple purposes:
1. Training and fine-tuning LLMs to adhere to the UCSP framework
2. Evaluating the effectiveness of the UCSP in various scenarios
3. Providing examples for developers and researchers working with the UCSP
4. Continuously improving and refining the UCSP framework based on generated data

For more detailed information about the dataset generation script, please refer to the README_SCRIPT.txt file.



LLAMAFILE:
Llamafile needs to have the system promt in json format for it to load, that is why there is a UCSP in .json format. 
load your model with these flags to load the system promt json file in the same DIR:
--system-prompt-file "UCSP - Universal CORE System Prompt v1.0.json"
